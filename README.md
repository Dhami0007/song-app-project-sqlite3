HOW TO GET STARTED:
-> Create a database in your directory using sqlite3
	- to create it, go to command prompt of the same directory
	- type 'sqlite3'
	- type '.open [your database name of choice].db'

-> Create tables in that database 
	- type '.read tableCreationQueries.txt'

Now the enviornment is set up.
Now we can run the Project 'miniproject1.py'
Note: when it asks for name of the database, give the name without '.db' at the end.
